# teachyourselfCS
Self Documenting my Learning of CS Fundamentals

I will be following the curriculum on https://teachyourselfcs.com

I've had a long career at several software companies but, without a CS degree I always felt that something was missing. 

Teach Yourself CS seems like the proper way to fill the gaps in my knowledge that I may not even know existed.

The order I'm doing this will be a little bit backwards due to my industry experience in system integration.
I'm starting with Martin Kleppman's [Designing Data Intensive Applications](https://smile.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable-ebook/dp/B06XPJML5D/)

I plan on primarily reading books and papers, and doing the exercises and projects as needed. 

I will start with the Core listed requirements and do the Extra items during a second iteration of this list. 
I've added some items/exercises from my own interests and from @jeffz4ng's [essay on teachyourselfcs](https://jeffzh4ng.com/essays/thoughts-on-teachyourselfcs.html)

Within this repo I will also post my answers to problem sets and other misc code created for this journey. 
I've had this GitHub account for over a decade. I hope within the next decade to complete all of the items listed.
